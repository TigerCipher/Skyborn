# Skyborn
---
A 3D Vulkan engine being developed mostly for experimental and research purposes

## Dependencies
---
- Vulkan SDK (Currently 1.2.x)

## Building
---
- Skyborn uses CMake 3.26, so have that installed
- For use with VS Code, I have written some useful scripts to automate adding new source files to the CMakeLists.txt
- See .vscode/tasks.json , build-all.bat, and add_source_files.py
  - This system requires python to be installed
